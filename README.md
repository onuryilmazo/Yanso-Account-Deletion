Deletion Process:
When you delete your account, all your personal data and associated records will be permanently removed. However, due to legal obligations, some of your data (such as transaction history) may be retained for a maximum period of six months.

Please note that this action is irreversible. Ensure you back up any necessary data before proceeding with account deletion.
